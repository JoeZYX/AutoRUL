# Implementation

There is a class named RemainingUsefulLife in `rul.py` which takes some parameters (see `rul.py`for more information). You can create an intance of this class by calling `rul.RemainingUsefulLife()`. 
After an instance is created, you should be able to call the methods; for example `compute_piecewise_linear_rul` or `plot_rul` on that instance.
